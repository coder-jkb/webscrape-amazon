This repository contains a Python script that utilizes Selenium to scrape product details from the Amazon India website. The script extracts information such as Product Name, Price, Rating, and Seller Name (if the product is not out of stock) from the specified URL: https://www.amazon.in/s?rh=n%3A6612025031&fs=true&ref=lp_6612025031_sar.
